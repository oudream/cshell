.TH CRUFT  "1" "Version 0.2"
.SH NAME
.B cruft
\- Encrypt files locally
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cruft
Replacement for the UNIX
.B crypt
command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cruft
is intended as a drop-in replacement for the UNIX
.B crypt
command, being equivalent in functionality and even easier to use than
the original.

.B cruft
runs either as a filter,

.I "cruft < infile > outfile"

or in file mode.

.I "cruft infile outfile"

.I "cruft infile > outfile"

.B cruft
will autodetect whether the target file needs to be encrypted or
decrypted. A file encrypted by cruft always has at its start a sequence
of exactly 9 marker characters, which happen to be defined as as
.I "253 (0xFD)."
This makes it unnecessary to specify whether the target file is to be
encrypted or decrypted, and indeed there is no provision for doing so.


.SH OPTIONS
None.


.SH FILES
.B ~/.key

The "key" file of random numbers generated by the
.I keygen
utility that is part of this package.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B $HOME

The
.I $HOME
environment variable, referenced by this utility, is normally set to
each user's home directory in any standard Linux or generic UNIX system.
No changes should be necessary.

.SH BUGS
Encrypted files have nine special marker characters (0xFD) at their head,
and this makes it easy to recognize that a) these files are encrypted,
and b) the type of encryption done. Fortunately, this scarcely compromises
the security of this method.

The
.I ~/.key
file for every encrypted file must be maintained
.I somewhere,
either in the user's home directory or on backup media. Regular changes of the
.I ~/.key
file, necessary for strictest security, can become an administrative
nightmare.
