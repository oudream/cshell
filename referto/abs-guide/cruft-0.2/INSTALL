                       Installation Instructions
                       ============ ============


1) Check the Makefile, and see whether any changes are necessary (they
   shouldn't be on any standard Linux or generic UNIX system).

   You may wish to add the -mpentium optimization to the CFLAGS line if
   you have a Pentium system.

2) make

3) make install (as root, of course)


Neither 'cruft' nor 'keygen' requires any special libraries, and they
should compile, link, and run correctly on any Linux or generic UNIX
system, including legacy ones.
